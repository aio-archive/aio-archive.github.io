# Introduction

Welcome to the AIO2023 course! This is an extensive one-year course that cover topics in AI, from the fundamental prerequisites to the most advanced and recent topics (like Generative AI, Diffusion models, CLIP, and Large language models). Note that each module is designed so that they are independent of each other. It's best if you take study the material module in sequential order, however, feel free to jump to the module that you prefer once you are confident about your foundation knowledge. If you already learn the basics (*eg. linear algebrea concepts, calculus, probability, and basic Python coding skills*) and want to learn more about AI, feel free to start from Module 4 to discover more advanced topics.
