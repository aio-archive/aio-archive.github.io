# Understand GNU / Linux

An alternative solution to AT&T Unix OS — which is not a free OS. GNU is an OS, often used with the Linux kernel.
An OS kernel is a program allocating a computer resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to programs.

There are many variants of GNU/Linux, including:

- Ubuntu

- Kali Linux

- MacOS (yes, MacOS)

# Linux Directory Structure

```{.bash}
/
├── home
├── usr
│   ├── bin
│   ├── sbin
│   └── local
│       ├── bin      # executable programs such as ssh, telnet, kill, and less
│       ├── sbin     # commands to boot the system such as reboot and shutdown
│       └── local
│           ├── bin  # user's executable programs
│           └── sbin # system administration commands belong to users
├── proc             # files for monitoring processes such as /proc/cpuinfo
├── etc              # configuration files
└── tmp              # temporary files
```

For example, if you use `ls /usr/bin`, you will see a list of executable programs on your computer:
