# 1. What is this ?

This is a website that serves as an archive of the AIO 2023 course that I have taken, including the lecture recordings, handouts, and solutions to the exercises. Initially, there is a Google Sheet but I want something more organized and flexible so this website is born after a looong time of procastination.

**All of the content is not owned by me, I only collect them for educational purposes. Under no circumstances should one use this for commercial purposes.** Other courses will be added in the future. In addition, you could also explore other resources that I have collected over time, mostly in the AI field and academic life (and recently in engineering).

# 2. What do you use to build this website ?

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)—static site generator that is very powerful and flexible—to build this website, deployed (for free) via GitHub Pages.
