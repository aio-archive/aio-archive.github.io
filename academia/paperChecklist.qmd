# Disclaimer
I am nowhere at a place to "advice" everyone about doing research. This list is my personal checklist for writing papers that I compiled by reading/watching advise from others. 
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

# Preparation
- [ ] Decide on a narrative - best done in close collaboration with a mentor
- [ ] Decide on a narrative - best done in close collaboration with a mentor
- [ ] Draft an abstract
- [ ] Do a round of reading through and editing - try reading it aloud to yourself
- [ ] Get sign-off from a mentor (if possible)
- [ ] Make a bullet point outline of the paper, emphasising sections and section titles, key figures and key experimental results. Do this in a google doc
- [ ] Get sign-off from a mentor (if possible)
- [ ] Double check exactly when the submission deadline is, ensure you’re converting time zones properly


::: {.boxed}
# Title and Abstract

- [ ] 1.1 Title is ≤ 15 words. Check for generic phrasing (e.g., “A Novel Framework...,” which conveys little information) and overly narrow focus (which may reduce the paper’s audience)—aim for concise but informative.
- [ ] 1.2 Title clearly reflects both the **problem** and the **solution**, and includes at least one technical keyword (e.g., jailbreak, OOD detection, graph learning).
- [ ] 1.3 Title avoids rare or ambiguous abbreviations. Terms like LLM, AI, and ML are acceptable in CS venues, but avoid abbreviations like AD (which could refer to advertisement or anomaly detection).
- [ ] 1.4 Abstract includes at least four key components: (1) problem/task definition, (2) proposed method or idea, (3) main results, and (4) broader impact or significance (some may be combined).
- [ ] 1.5 Abstract avoids undefined abbreviations and vague descriptors (e.g., “important,” “novel,” “state-of-the-art” without context).
- [ ] 1.6 Bonus: Abstract includes at least one concrete, quantitative result or insight to make the work stand out. For instance, “our method achieves 11.2× acceleration in test-time inference for jailbreak detection.”

## 3 facets of your work  
- Explain your method through its contrasts
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Introduction
- [ ] 2.1 The main problem or task is clearly defined within the first two paragraphs.
- [ ] 2.2 Motivation includes either (a) real-world use cases or (b) citations to prior work—ideally both.
- [ ] 2.3 The introduction ends with a brief overview of the proposed method and its name.
- [ ] 2.4 Contributions are explicitly itemized (e.g., “(1) first framework for ..., (2) new dataset for ..., (3) extensive evaluation on ...”).
- [ ] 2.5 Each contribution is specific and verifiable—avoid vague claims such as “we provide insights” or “we improve understanding.”
- [ ] 2.6 Bonus: Include a compelling figure on the first page—e.g., comparison to prior work, performance highlight, or visual explanation of the core idea.
- [ ] Outline a set of 3 defendable contributions:
- [ ] What is the problem that the paper is solving;  
- [ ] Why that problem (the importance of the problem);  
- [ ] What are the current approaches to solving this problem and what is wrong about them;  
- [ ] What are the contributions of the paper;
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Method
- [ ] No new notation. If you need it, add to the background section.  
- [ ] Anything written in the Method section is expected to be tested
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Experiment
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Results
The goal of the Results section is to verify the contributions of the paper.
- [ ] The tables are the stars.  
- [ ] One table = one experiment  
- [ ] Describe the table and the conclusion of the experiment  
- [ ] Avoid new notation, method, data. Everything must be set up in the Experiment section.
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Discussion / Analysis
- [ ] Check robustness of the contributions  
- [ ] Ask specific questions that go beyond the core, now-proven results  
- [ ] Ablation of specific method choices  
- [ ] Qualitative analysis of known gains  
- [ ] Avoid random experiment
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Conclusion
- [ ] No new information  
- [ ] Abstract but more specific  
- [ ] A brief summary (one or two sentences) of what the paper is about  
- [ ] A summary of the key findings of the paper  
- [ ] A list of potential improvements.
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Figures

> "Figures are an important element of reporting the findings of your research. The reader usually starts by reading the abstract, conclusion and figures. If the figures are self-contained and convincing, it is likely that the reviewers will accept the paper without asking a large number of questions. If they have to read the whole text to understand the worth of each figure, this will slow their progress and could make them impatient, hence decrease the chance of giving recommendation for your paper."

- [ ] Place the figures at the top of the page to save space.  
- [ ] Should fill the entire `\linewidth` (or `\textwidth`) of the page.  
- [ ] Must not be stretched disproportionally.  
- [ ] Use `rcParams` in Matplotlib to adjust the font size of the figure.  
- [ ] Add `baseline` option in `tikz` package if you have to subfigures and want them to perfectly align (use `\input{fig1}` instead of `\begin{figure}`)  
- [ ] The captions should be descriptive enough that together with the figure it can be standalone.  
- [ ] Use vector graphics whenever possible (PDF, SVG, TikZ, ...) 
- [ ] The text in the figure should be readable without zooming  
- [ ] The font of the text in the figure should be the same as the font of the body text.

Some examples of good figures (imo):

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%;
 padding-bottom: 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"
    src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGkn9tNXx0/bhrEy8pBzq5Ix8Bzp7WDdA/view?embed" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen">
  </iframe>
</div>
:::
<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Tables

- [ ] Use thick lines at the top and bottom of the table.  
- [ ] Avoid using the vertical lines as much as possible.
- [ ] The caption of the table is **above** the table, not below (like Figures).
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}    
# Grammar

- Be consistent on pronouns and tenses
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Misc

## Paragraphs

- [ ] 1 paragraph = 1 idea  
- [ ] The paragraphs should be short (3–5 sentences)  
- [ ] The paragraph should have flow:  
  - [ ] logical flow of ideas — sequential in time, general to specific, logical arguments  
  - [ ] parallel sentence structures  
  - [ ] transition words (if necessary, do not overrely on them). Use simple ones (BUT instead of Nevertheless...)  
- [ ] Pairs of ideas joined by "and", "or", or "but" should be written in parallel form.  
- [ ] Proofread, proofread, and proofread until you are sick and obsessed with your paper  

## Clutters

> The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.

Clutteredness is being precise, not counting the words.

- [ ] Avoid: _successful solution, extremely flabbergasted_  
- [ ] Avoid: _It is noticeable that..._  
- [ ] Most of the time you don't need _there is / there are_  
- [ ] _Can be regarded as_ vs. _is_  
- [ ] Use passive voice sparingly and deliberately  
- [ ] Use strong verbs; avoid: _take, have, get, to be_  
- [ ] Avoid noun-ifying verbs (e.g., _compare_ → _make a comparison_)  
- [ ] Eliminate negatives  
- [ ] Avoid overuse of adverbs (_generally, mostly..._)

## General

- [ ] Use precise verbs  
- [ ] Quotation marks: Use ``something'' instead of "something"  
- [ ] Avoid acronyms unless universally known  
- [ ] Keep the tone balanced between high-level and technical  
- [ ] Important concepts: explain using text, figures, and math  
- [ ] Avoid ending paragraphs with only 2–3 words on a line  
- [ ] Fill the allowed page limit (e.g., write 8 full pages if the limit is 8)  
- [ ] Use parallelism in lists and structures
:::

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

::: {.boxed}
# Citation / Bibliography

- [ ] Dirty, inconsistent references imply you don't care  
- [ ] Don't copy-paste from Google Scholar—check and clean  
- [ ] Cite original papers, not derivative ones  
- [ ] Avoid massive citation lists like "[1–20]".  
- [ ] Prefer grouped author-year references in chronological order, e.g.,  
  [ ] > "Books and articles on writing scientific papers exist [Day, 1998; Ashby, 2000; Plaxco, 2010]."  
- [ ] Use "?" search to check for missing citations

## 1. 🎯 Title and Abstract




---

## 2. 📚 Introduction






---

## 3. 🔍 Related Work

- [ ] 3.1 All cited works are connected to your method, baseline, or task.
- [ ] 3.2 At least one baseline from the top-3 most cited recent papers on the topic is mentioned.
- [ ] 3.3 Related work does not exceed 1.5 pages (unless survey-style paper).
- [ ] 3.4 You may use LLMs for searching the related work, but double triple check each of the paper -- do not trust LLMs!!!!
- [ ] 3.5 Bonus: use related work section to introduce baseline algorithms -- show a table for your proposal better than the existing ones




---

## 4. 🧪 Method

- [ ] 4.1 All symbols are defined before use.
- [ ] 4.2 Each equation is referenced with inline explanation (e.g., “Eq. (3) defines the loss over…”). If an equation is never referenced, consider making it inline to save space.
- [ ] 4.3 All modules or components of the method are illustrated or described in text or figures.
- [ ] 4.4 Each subsection ideally aligns with parts of the overview figure. Add a short summary paragraph before diving into subsections.
- [ ] 4.5 You do not need both overview figure and pseudo code in the main text -- move the pseudo code to the appendix
- [ ] 4.6 The method is reproducible without referring to the appendix or external code—reviewers should understand everything from the main text.
- [ ] 4.7 Bonus: Can anything be removed from this section without reducing clarity? Do not hesitate to cut: more math ≠ better paper.




---

## 5. 📊 Experiments

- [ ] 5.1 At least 3 datasets are used (unless the paper introduces a new dataset).
- [ ] 5.2 At least 3 baseline methods are compared. Are they state-of-the-art? Justify why these baselines are chosen.
- [ ] 5.3 At least 1 ablation study is included.
- [ ] 5.4 Standard deviation or confidence intervals are reported where appropriate.
- [ ] 5.5 Hardware environment, software libraries, and hyperparameter settings are described.
- [ ] 5.6 Negative results (if any) are explained, not omitted—failure cases are valuable.
- [ ] 5.7 Evaluation metrics are clearly defined and justified.
- [ ] 5.8 All figures and tables are referenced in the main text.
- [ ] 5.9 Beyond showing numbers and saying “we perform well,” at least one deeper insight or analysis is provided (e.g., why it works, where it fails).
- [ ] 5.10 Bonus: Think about how easy others can reproduce your work? If you have any "dirty tricks" -- remove them pls.





---

## 6. 🧾 Writing Quality and Style

- [ ] 6.1 All abbreviations are defined at first use (even ML, LLM, etc.) -- do not redefine them again and again.
- [ ] 6.2 No sentence exceeds 25 words without a comma or period.
- [ ] 6.3 No paragraph exceeds 10 lines.
- [ ] 6.4 Passive voice usage < 30% of the total number of sentences.
- [ ] 6.5 Bonus: Have you noticed that your paper are full of the fancy LLM words, like encompass, intricate, etc?




---

## 7. 🖼️ Figures and Tables

- [ ] 7.1 Each figure/table has a caption ≥ 2 lines that includes interpretation or context. Do not just place it without explanation—reviewers will get lost.
- [ ] 7.2 Font size in all figures is ≥ 8pt and all labels are fully visible (not cropped).
- [ ] 7.3 Plots use colors that remain distinguishable when printed in grayscale—some reviewers will print your paper.
- [ ] 7.4 Each method mentioned in the results appears in either the legend or table column headers.
- [ ] 7.5 Figures appear at the top of pages rather than mid-text or at the bottom (soft rule, but improves readability).
- [ ] 7.6 Figures and tables are not redundant—each provides new or complementary information.
- [ ] Bonus: All figures are in **lossless formats** (e.g., PDF for vector graphics). Absolutely no low-resolution images allowed.





---

## 8. 🧱 Structure and Formatting

- [ ] 8.1 All LaTeX warnings and bad boxes have been resolved.
- [ ] 8.2 Section headers follow the standard paper structure (e.g., Introduction, Method, Experiments, etc.).
- [ ] 8.3 All appendix sections are explicitly referenced in the main text (e.g., “Appendix B.2 shows…”).
- [ ] 8.4 No **orphan lines** anywhere in the paper—avoid single-line section headers or short lines at the top/bottom of columns.
- [ ] 8.5 No two figures or tables are placed consecutively without explanatory text between them.




---

## 9. 📎 References

- [ ] 9.1 All references are in the correct format for the target venue.
- [ ] 9.2 All datasets, toolkits, and models used are cited.
- [ ] 9.3 At least one paper from the target venue (conference/journal) is cited.
- [ ] 9.4 Self-citations ≤ 20% of total citations.
- [ ] 9.5 BibTeX file has been deduplicated and spell-checked.




---

## 10. 🛑 Citation Sanity Check (LLM-Generated Risk)

- [ ] 10.1 All citations were **manually verified to exist**—title, authors, venue, and year match a real, published paper.
- [ ] 10.2 No hallucinated references from LLM tools are included.
- [ ] 10.3 If a citation was generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, or similar, it has been cross-checked on **Google Scholar**, **Semantic Scholar**, or publisher sites.




---

## 11. 🧠 Sanity Checks Before Submission

- [ ] 11.1 PDF compiles in Overleaf/TeX with no errors or bad boxes.
- [ ] 11.2 File name follows the submission guideline format (e.g., no underscores or author names if anonymized).
- [ ] 11.3 No author-identifying information exists in metadata, supplementary files, or file names. Check your code repository and images too.
- [ ] 11.4 The paper length complies with the page limit, including references and appendices (if counted).
- [ ] 11.5 The paper has been read start-to-finish by someone not on the author list, without them needing to stop for clarification.
- [ ] 11.6 All co-authors are listed and properly acknowledged—this is surprisingly often overlooked.
- [ ] 11.7 Bonus: After submission, log in from a different device and OS (e.g., Mac, Windows) to verify that the uploaded version renders correctly.

[`cs-paper-checklist`](https://github.com/yzhao062/cs-paper-checklist)

Key Preparation
Decide on a narrative - best done in close collaboration with a mentor
Draft an abstract
Do a round of reading through and editing - try reading it aloud to yourself
Get sign-off from a mentor (if possible)
Make a bullet point outline of the paper, emphasising sections and section titles, key figures and key experimental results. Do this in a google doc
Get sign-off from a mentor (if possible)
Double check exactly when the submission deadline is, ensure you’re converting time zones properly
Writing Stage
Note: These can largely be done in any order
Draft the introduction.
Do this in Overleaf in the correct conference template
Get LLM feedback and edit
Get 1+ round of feedback from a mentor & iterate
Draft the prose of the main body (excl related work, and excl appendices which can be very last minute). It's OK to leave some things blank or as placeholders, just make sure you know what's missing
For anything to do with fiddly LaTeX, use an LLM unless you *really* know what you're doing, and if you’ve been stuck for >10 mins try to ask someone for help
Get the key experimental results and put them into the paper as numbers or figures
Make draft figures
Draft the related work (if you don't know what to do, use deep research, then ask a mentor)
Do a round of editing and polishing on the whole thing - focus on the intro and figures
Run it through multiple LLMs for feedback. Put several good papers in their context window too. Always tell it “here is my colleague’s/someone else’s paper” and ask “what is the biggest problem with this” to avoid sycophancy
Ask a mentor to give feedback on the whole thing (if possible)
Do this multiple times if possible
Get feedback on the whole thing from one person not on the project, eg via a paper swap. Take this seriously.
Have them repeat back to you what they think your contribution is, why it matters, and what evidence you provide for it/why that evidence is compelling - if this is wrong, this is a big deal and you need to edit until it’s fixed!
Do a second round of editing and polishing on the whole thing
Decide on the authorship order:
If there are 2 or more main contributors, I recommend being co-first authors
By default I recommend randomising the first author order, and putting an asterisk saying it was randomised (do NOT do alphabetical, it's not standard in ML and screws over people with surnames late in the alphabet)
If you both agree one person contributed more, they should go first
If there's disagreement, go and read Chris Olah's blog post about credit allocation
If there's still disagreement, please co-write an author contributions statement, then see if you now agree
If there's still disagreement, try to get a neutral party to adjudicate
Think carefully for anyone who contributed to the project and should maybe be an author, check in with them. Try hard to not snub people.
Write the appendices - please leave this to the end as they're rarely read, and can be cut for time if needed
Optional: Make your code available using https://anonymous.4open.science/ and link from the paper - this shows reproducibility/effort
The code doesn’t need to be polished (and you can likely get away with it not being runnable) right now, the key thing is that it exists. Make it nice before Arxiv/the camera ready
Final Stages
Once you have a draft you're happy with, check how many pages it is. If you're above the official page limit, start cutting down page count
Ask yourself which subsections are least important, and move them to the appendix
Condense your figures, eg combining graphs into one figure with several facet plots
Do minor tweaks/word level editing for conciseness
Ask an LLM how to be more concise
I’d guess this can shave down 0.5-1.5 pages of space - if you need more, do the others first!
[If NeurIPS] Do the NeurIPS checklist!! Do not leave it to the last minute, it's long and you get desk rejected without it
Sanity check for anonymity
There are no github or HuggingFace links that expose a username
If you need to share code, use https://anonymous.4open.science/
If you need to share model weights make an anonymous HuggingFace account
Ensure your name is not in there, or other identifying information - give it to an LLM and ask
Check your paper for TODO and ??, fix them
Submission
Submit the abstract
Do this at least 24 hours before the deadline, and keep re-submitting
Choose keywords and topic according to "do I want reviewers who looked for this topic/keyword to be reviewing my paper", which is not always the same as where it best fits.
Submit the paper
Do this at least 24 hours before the deadline and keep re-submitting! You do NOT want to have your internet go down or OpenReview to crash at the last minute.
Public release
You can release your work publicly even during the anonymous peer review process for most ML conferences. But prioritise getting a good conference submission first.
Make a list of all the additional polishing/new results you didn’t have time for, and think are worth it
Estimate how long each will take, and how valuable it would be
Remove the ones that don’t seem worth it
Do what remains
Put them in the paper
If you cut important content to meet the page limit, put it back in - Arxiv does not need to be identical to what is published at the conference
Add an acknowledgements section - be generous, thank everyone who gave feedback or otherwise helped
Co-write an author contribution section - try to emphasise the parts you're each proudest of! This is a positive-sum game
Have the email of a corresponding author, typically one or both first authors
Draft a tweet thread
There's an art to writing good tweet threads. Note that 95% of people only see tweet 1, so it needs to be great and is where most of your effort should go. Tweet 2 matters a bit, later tweets don't. It needs to:
Be accessible to an ML person who has no initial idea that your tweet is about a paper at all
Communicate the key insight of the paper in 280 characters with simple language
Have an eye catching figure
Do not have any links in tweet 1, it de-boosts it
Get feedback from someone good at Twitter, if possible
Draft a LessWrong post
Clean up the code and make it public on Github
Link in the LW post and at the end of the paper abstract
Make sure to have a license. MIT or Apache 2.0 License are good if you want the code to be easily usable by others
Bonus: Have a helpful README
Bonus: Have a python notebook showing how to run the basics of your code
Optional: Draft a blog post. This is for giving an accessible summary of the work. 
Begin with a bullet point outline
If you think there's genuinely interesting takeaways, tacit knowledge, nuance, advice for future work, wild speculation, etc, please talk about it! The paper format sadly disincentives this kind of valuable knowledge
Release
Put the paper on Arxiv
Note that it takes about 1 working day for the paper to appear publicly on Arxiv
If you have not submitted to Arxiv before you'll need someone with 3+ papers to endorse you for the ML category (cs.LG), get this out of the way earlier if possible
Post the tweet thread once the paper is on Arxiv.
Post the blog post
